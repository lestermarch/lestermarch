## Introduction ðŸ‘‹

I work as a cloud and platform engineering contractor and consultant for a European-based software and data consultancy. I am heavily focused on the Microsoft Azure cloud, and cover a range of technologies from Azure Machine Learing though to Azure Kubernetes Service. My background is in datacenters and systems administration, and I maintain a passion for getting "under the hood" into core compute, storage, and networking technologies. Nowadays I mostly work in a platform engineering, SRE, or "DevOps" capacity depending on the project, and enjoy using infrastructure as code and pipeline tooling to thoroughly automate the build and management of cloud platforms.

While I generally contribute to private repos on and off GitHub for professional projects, I also aim to publish public repos for tutorial or example puproses. Some notable repos are listed below. All content is representative of my own personal opinion.
